# Moral Vision Assessment

Assess the quality of moral vision regarding a situation, revealing what clearer, more loving seeing might show.

---

## When to Use

- User faces an ethical dilemma or moral complexity
- User asks "What am I missing morally?" or "Help me see the ethical dimensions"
- User wants deeper understanding beyond rules or consequences
- Request for "Murdochian analysis" of a moral situation
- User senses they're not seeing a situation's full moral reality

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The ethical situation or dilemma |
| current_perception | Yes | How the user currently sees the moral landscape |
| stated_values | No | What the user believes they care about |
| decision_facing | No | What choice or action is being contemplated |

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: What Do You See?

Map the user's current moral perception:
- Who are the parties and how are they characterized?
- What moral categories are being applied (right/wrong, fair/unfair)?
- What seems ethically obvious or settled?
- What principles or rules are being invoked?

**Murdoch's insight:** "The moral life is something that goes on continually, not something that is switched off in between the occurrence of explicit moral choices." Vision precedes choice.

### Step 2: What Is Ego Adding?

Identify where self-interest may be distorting moral vision:
- Does the perception conveniently serve the user's interests or comfort?
- Are others being seen as fully real, or as obstacles/instruments?
- Where is self-righteousness operating?
- What might the user not want to see?

**Key question:** "If you had no stake in this, would you see it the same way?"

### Step 3: Who Are the Individuals?

Move from moral abstractions to particular persons:
- Who specifically will be affected?
- What is their particular situation, not just their category?
- What is real about their lives that hasn't been considered?
- Who is being reduced to a type rather than seen as an individual?

**Murdoch's insight:** "Love is the perception of individuals." Moral vision requires seeing persons, not abstractions.

### Step 4: What Would Love See?

Direct "a just and loving gaze upon individual reality":
- What would it mean to see each affected party with love?
- What would genuine attention to their reality reveal?
- Where is the perception "thin" and where might it be enriched?
- What would a truly fair-minded person notice?

This is not about sentiment but about accuracy—love sees truly.

### Step 5: Orientation Toward the Good

Consider the situation in light of the Good:
- What does virtue require here—not rule-following but genuine moral quality?
- What action would come from clearer vision, not just correct calculation?
- How would a good person see this situation?
- What does moving toward reality, away from illusion, require?

**Murdoch's insight:** "Goodness is connected with the attempt to see the unself... to see and to respond to the real world in the light of a virtuous consciousness."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Moral Vision Assessment

### Current Moral Perception
[How the user is seeing the ethical landscape]

### What Ego May Be Adding
[Analysis of self-interested distortions in the perception]

### The Individuals Involved
| Person | How Currently Seen | What Attention Might Reveal |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| [name/role] | [current perception] | [richer, more particular view] |

### What Love Would See
[A morally enriched perception through just and loving attention]

### Orientation Toward the Good
[Reflection on what virtue requires and what clearer vision indicates]

### The Question of Vision
[An invitation to sit with what better seeing might ask of the user]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not simply apply rules or calculate consequences
- Do not tell the user what to do; illuminate what clearer vision might show
- Honor moral complexity—better seeing often reveals difficulty, not easy answers
- Attend to particulars, not just principles
- The goal is not to judge the user but to invite clearer seeing

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I found out my colleague has been padding their expense reports. It's not massive amounts, but it's definitely fraud. We're friends. Should I report them?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Moral Vision Assessment

### Current Moral Perception

You see a binary: Report or don't report. Your colleague has committed fraud, which is wrong. Reporting is the "right" thing by rule. But friendship creates a competing obligation. You're caught between loyalty and honesty, seeking which rule wins.

This framing, while not wrong, may be thin. It treats the situation as a logic problem: given competing duties, which takes precedence? Murdoch would ask: what are you actually seeing, and what might you be missing?

### What Ego May Be Adding

Consider what the ego might be contributing to this perception:

**Self-protection:** Both reporting and not-reporting carry risks. The frame of "should I" may be seeking permission for whichever feels safer.

**Moral self-image:** You know fraud is wrong and may need to see yourself as someone who opposes it. But you also value friendship and may need to see yourself as loyal. The dilemma may be partly about which self-image to protect.

**Abstraction as distance:** Thinking about "fraud" and "reporting" in the abstract is easier than thinking about your specific colleague—their situation, their reasons, what might happen to them.

**The wish not to be involved:** The cleanest outcome would be if this had never happened, or if someone else discovered it. Both options you're considering involve you, uncomfortably.

### The Individuals Involved

| Person | How Currently Seen | What Attention Might Reveal |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Colleague | Friend who committed fraud | A particular person with financial pressures? Poor judgment? Rationalization? A pattern or a mistake? A whole life you know parts of. |
| You | Moral actor facing a dilemma | Also someone with fears about consequences, relationships with the company, perhaps resentments or admirations you haven't examined |
| Others affected | Abstract (company, other employees) | Specific people whose budgets may be cut, who follow rules honestly, who may be affected by precedent |
| The colleague's family | Not present in your framing | Real people whose lives would be affected by job loss or scandal |

### What Love Would See

A just and loving gaze would see your colleague as particular: not "a fraud" but a specific person who has done something wrong for specific reasons you may or may not understand. Love asks: What is their actual situation? Why might they have done this? What pressures have you not seen?

This does not excuse fraud. Murdoch is not sentimental. But love sees clearly, and clear seeing includes the person, not just the act.

Love would also see you clearly: your fear of confrontation, perhaps, or your complicated feelings about this friendship, or your relationship to the company and its rules. What do you actually feel when you imagine each course of action?

And love would see the invisible others: colleagues who submit honest expenses, people who might be affected by a culture of small frauds, the organizational trust that is eroded or protected.

### Orientation Toward the Good

The question is not primarily "What rule applies?" but "What does genuine virtue require here?"

A good person would not ignore fraud out of mere convenience—but neither would they treat a friend as simply a "case" to be reported. A good person would likely:

**See clearly first:** You may need to understand more before you know what seeing clearly requires. What is the scale? Is this ongoing or past? Does your colleague know it's wrong?

**Consider the relationship:** Not as an excuse, but as a reality. You have access to conversation that a stranger wouldn't. Is there a way to address this that honors both truth and friendship?

**Accept the difficulty:** There may be no clean option. A good person doesn't expect ethical life to be comfortable.

**Act from vision, not calculation:** Whatever you do, let it come from genuinely seeing the situation and the people, not from rule-application or self-protection.

### The Question of Vision

Before asking "What should I do?", sit with this: "Am I seeing everyone involved—including myself—clearly? Or am I seeing a dilemma designed to produce an answer?"

The work of attention may need to come first. Talk to your colleague, perhaps. Learn more. Let the situation become particular before it becomes a decision. You may find that with clearer seeing, the way forward becomes evident—not because a rule decided it, but because you finally saw what was really there.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Iris Murdoch** expert persona. Use it when ethical situations need deeper seeing rather than rule-application, when the user senses moral complexity that simple frameworks don't capture, and when the quality of perception is as important as the eventual action.
